# Why a data science track?

Direct statistical analysis is typically only possible for data that is structured and tidy, and is small enough to fit into computer memory. However, many modern biological data sets are semi-structured/unstructured and often extremely large - for example, electronic health records, time series data from wearable health trackers, medical imaging or histology slides, and genomics data from array or sequencing experiments.

Dealing with these types of data requires data science skills not currently covered by the MB syllabus. In particular, mastery of the following skills would be a competitive advantage:

1. Interacting with the external world and converting data from one format to another
  1. Multiple sources
    1. Relational database
    2. NoSQL databases
    3. Spreadsheets
    4. File system
    5. Via a custom API
    6. Via web scraping
  2. Multiple formats
    1. XML
    2. JSON
    3. Tabular
    4. Specialized (e.g. laboratory assay, imaging, genomics data sets)
2. Converting unstructured or semi-structured data into structured tidy data (data munging or wrangling)
3. Data cleaning, transformation and recoding
4. Model formulation, fitting and statistical inference
5. Model optimization
  1. Use of appropriate algorithms and data structures
  2. Use of vectorization
  3. Using compiled rather than interpreted code, which may require coding of numerical algorithms into a compiled language and interfering with a higher level language such as R
  4. Multi-core processing
6. Working with big data that cannot fit into memory
  1. Chunking
  2. Distributed computing (remote computing and working with clusters)
  3. Working with streaming (online) data
  4. Probabilistic data structures
7. Reporting and visualization of complex data sets and analytic results
8. Construction of reproducible analysis pipelines
