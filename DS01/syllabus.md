Evaluation
----

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at task in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine learning tasks are usually described in terms of how the machine learning system should process an **example**.

Types of tasks include:

- Classification
- Classification with missing data
- Regression
- Transcription
- Machine interpretation
- Structured learning
