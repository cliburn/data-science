# DS01: Software tools for data science

A data scientist needs to master several different tools to obtain, process, analyze, visualize and interpret large biomedical data sets such as electronic health records, medical images, and genomic sequences. It is also critical that the data scientist masters the best practices associated with using these tools, so that the results are robust and reproducible. Foundational tools for students to assemble a data science toolkit that will be taught are the Unix shell, text editors, regular expressions, relational and NoSQL databases, and the Python programming language for data munging, visualization and machine learning. Best practices that students will learn include the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) practices for data stewardship, as well as reproducible analysis with literate programming, version control and containerization.
